<p>After school I left Victoria with my P plates and beloved 1975 HJ Monaro for the Northern Territory where I worked in the mining industry for the next couple of years. I spent most of my time maintaining and servicing hydraulic machinery. When the mine closed I returned home to take a job with J&S Ladhams Contracting. As an operator I was exposed to a broad range of tractors, loaders, slurry tanks, hay and silage equipment. </p>

<p>This lead me to Pearson Ag (Colac) a then newly established Australian branch of a New Zealand based company Pearson Engineering. I spent the next six years as workshop and parts manager, fitting new Pearson loaders and assembling Buckton wagons, Sam spreaders, Pearson slurry tanks, Jaylor mixers, Sulky spreaders, Quinn fork lifts, and Aitchison seed drills, along with warranty assessments, field work and dealer network parts distribution.</p>

<p>In 2004 Pearson Engineering the parent company decided to close the Australian workshop. It was at this point I saw an opportunity to continue the parts and warranty service in Australia as my own business. I began trading as AC Service and Parts Pty Ltd in 2004 and I continue to supply an ever-growing range of products to machinery dealers and customers throughout Australia.</p>

<p>I pride myself on quality customer service, product knowledge and excellent problem solving skills.</p>
